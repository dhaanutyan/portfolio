            <h1>One-on-one</h1>
            <h4>Mentoring can be a great way to share knowledge and help someone be successful in their personal or professional life. But many potential mentors are often too busy to commit to regular meetings, or they have a hard time connecting with people seeking help. </h4>
            <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
            <h4>The study case below is about designing an experience where prospective mentors and mentees can be matched, based on similar interests, location, and availability.</h4>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Answering the question of what is mentorship and how the process looks like nowadays I have done some readings and market research to define that idea is quite popular and a lot of big companies thinking about their mentorship services. I have checked the Facebook template for groups, a LinkedIn program of mentorship and some stand-alone platforms.</p>
            <p>Despite the popularity of the idea, the quality of services is still under the question. But what if users are delighted with current experience? </p>
            <h3>User research</h3>
            <p>Since I haven't had much experience in mentorship, I have written the question list and organize six user interviews with people who was mentors or mentees. It has helped me to understand the process and the audience. Collecting and cleaning the results was performed with Google Spreadsheets. </p>

            <h3>Problem defenition</h3>
            <p>Well, users are not delighted. </p>
            <p>Mentee can't find a mentor, complaining about the poor quality of mentorship, and the absence of mentors. </p>
            <p>Mentors problem is in lack of time. How to save mentors time and make them available more often? But where are mentors losing their time?</p>
            <p>They are spending a lot of time on bad matches, creating plans for each mentee, checking how mentee is doing, rescheduling meetings, booking the place for meeting. It looks like a lot of manual work. <br>
            </p>
            <p> When machines can organize mentorship process, It will increase the efficiency of mentors and the quality of mentorship can be influenced by guidelines for mentors and feedback from mentee.</p>

            <p>We also leave place for development a community of volunteers and people who adopted an animal, for monetisation by advertising and for connecting donations with goods and services for animals.

		    <h3>Capabilities
</h3>
		    <p>Working on a level of skills can help you to specify what should be done and for your team (pity I haven't one now) to negotiate time, budget and organize efficient development. Due to the fact we are building a product from scratch, it is better to start with some small and core ideas for checking if we are on the right track.<br>
	        </p>
			   <p> I am curious how short should be the list of capabilities from mentees and mentors sides the prototype can be easily built in a week month and the main idea tested with users. </p>

		    <h3>User journey</h3>
            <p>According to the information collected during the interview sessions, the first contact is crucial for both sides, and it is also a moment where mentors and mentees are wasting a lot of time.</p>
            <p>Since the first engagement of mentors is our core functionality, I have visualized it in details, dividing the flow into 6 logical parts. It will help to analyze and discuss not just all process but each step separately.</p>
            <li>I. The events which precede the downloading or opening tool </li>
           <li>II. Setting up the profile </li>
			 <li>  III. Making decisions on a list level </li>
           <li>IV. Making a decision on an open page level </li>
            <li>V. Making a decision after the first chat, setting up a meeting. </li>
            <li>VI. Making a decision after the first meeting</li>

            <h3>Interaction solution</h3>
            <p>Since one of the main goals is to release human from work as much as possible I have started to think about what kind of interface has the possibility to decrease manual usage. </p>
            <p>Using chatbots ot voice interfaces can be also risky if the type of the flow will not fits the creteria or audience will not be ready for the sharp move.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Howewer it sound like a good concept for first round of prototype testing. I can validate idea and decide depends on user feedback.</p>

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>For testing, I have moved my mockups from Sketch to XD since it is much useful for mobile prototyping and also can imitate voice control (horrible though). I have done a couple of testings of testing myself and have fixed some minor problems. </p>
            <p>After testing with two participants of user interview, I have collected feedback:</p>
            <li> The colors are boring</li>
           <li> Would like to see more interaction</li>
          <li> Voice idea is ok, but I prefer less test on the screen. Your bot is too chatty haha</li>
            <li> Need more information about mentor. Can it be video?</li>
            <li> Where is social networks links?</li>
            <li> Can I check the old school version just to compare?</li>
            <li> How could I know all chatbot commands?</li>
            <li> It looks like some options missing</li>
  
              <li> I feel limited by this view </li>
              <li>Maybe I should get use to it </li>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>It was quite an exciting week for me. I have never dived so deep into mentor vs. mentee relationship. I have missed teamwork processes a bit. Developing this product would be much fun with somebody.</p>
            <p>I am glad I have decided to go for an interview instead of the survey. It has changed my perspective of view completely. </p>
            <p>I am also happy I have risked and tested voice interface idea. It was a good experience for me and it worst trying. During the testing, users were very enthusiastic in the beginning and a bit confused in the end. It seems conversational design should be tested with more flexible prototype and requires more testing and fixing.</p>
            <p>I would not give up this concept, but it will be interesting to develop a different idea and A/B test them. </p>
            <p>There is a lot of should be done in the future before this product could face the audience. There can be more journeys, more user needs, more devices and at the same time more complexity. My point is in keeping it simple and trying to avoid to add functionality which can be replaced by system apps.</p>
