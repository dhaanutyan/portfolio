			   <h1>Building a sustainable habit of cooking</h1>
			   <h4>A big percentage of meal kit subscribers cancel their subscriptions within the first months. In general, it is a group of users who are willing to try new things and unsubscribing soon after. </h4>
			<h3>Business goal</h3>
			<p>Define if there is a solution on a design level which can keep users longer. Create prototype and test it as soon as possible to get the user feedback about the solution.</p>
			<h3>User problem</h3>
			  <p>Why are users dropping from subscriptions and what can change their behavior?
		   Lets assume the people of 20-35 years old is dropping out of various subscription programs because they are having a lack of motivation.</p>
		    
		    <p>A couple of user interviews with people who have left the subscription after short stay might be an excellent technique to validate the assumption. </p>
		

            <h3>User interviews</h3>
            <p>I have written the questions list and organize three user interviews with people who terminated or hav'nt try meal kir delivery yet. It has helped me to understand the problem and the audience.</p>

            <h3>Interviews outcome</h3>
            <p>Motivation is a problem. The group of users requires different types of engagement wich includes challenges and long term goals. They like learning new recipes but feel the lack of support on this journey. People who didn't try it is facing doubts if they have enough cooking skills. They also would like to have more fun and trying it with friends to check who will succeed better.</p>

		    <h3>Conception</h3>
			  
		    <li>The step-by-step learning program for millennials who want to increase their cooking skills inside the existing service.</li>
		      <li>Instructions are provided as a video lesson. </li>
		   <li>Each week enrolled student will receive a box for the next lesson. </li>
		    <li>The complexity of recipes will grow.</li>
		      <li>To completing the lesson, they should add a photo of the result to the app.</li>
		      <li>After each step user will have a certificate of HelloFresh cook.</li>
		      <li>Users will have the possibility to share their progress with friends.</li>
		      <li>To make it cost-effective, the program can start every three months so everybody will do it together. </li>

		    <h3>Implementation in current architecture</h3>
		    <p>Since the current interface already exists the implementation of additional parts might create various architectural problems affecting user experience from navigation to layout structure. </p>

		    <h3>User journey</h3>
		    <p>Completing the lesson and completing the course are the smaller and bigger loop of engaging the user.&nbsp; I have visualized it in details, dividing the flow into 5 logical parts. It will help to analyze and discuss not just all process but each step separately.</p>

            <h3>The insparation</h3>
            <p>For inspiration, I have checked how another organizer their eLearning and gamified interfaces for mobile phones. In the layout I will need progress bars, learning map, success screens, and step-by-step video controls. </p>

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>For the wireframing, I have chosen the most common part of the journey: completing the lesson. Since one of the goals is to check this feature as soon as possible, I have taken just one class for the moment, assuming that in reality, it will be enough to check users interest to the conception. </p>

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>For testing, I have moved my mockups from Sketch to Adobe XD since it is much useful for mobile prototyping. I have done a couple of testings of testing myself and have fixed some minor problems. </p>

            <p></p>
            <p>After testing with two participants of user interview, I have collected feedback:</p>
          
              <li>Like the idea of copleting the classes with the meal kits.</li>
          
            <li> Would like to see more interaction</li>
           
              <li> Would like to see more different classes</li>
            
           <li> Would like to see the onboarding</li>
            <li> Wondering if friends can cheat with their classes</li>
            <li> Looks very simple, but engaging. Wondering what king of bonuses could be opened in progress page</li>
            <li> The name of classes in progress and in sliding is confusing</li>
            <li> Would like to understand how long will be all learning journey</li>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>It was quite an exciting weeks for me.I have missed teamwork processes a bit. Developing this product would be much fun with somebody.</p>
            <p>I am glad I have decided to go for an interview instead of the survey. It has changed my perspective of view completely. </p>
            <p>I am also happy I have risked and tested gamification idea. It was a good experience for me and it worst trying. During the testing, users were very enthusiastic, but it seems gamified design should be tested with more flexible prototype and requires more testing and fixing. However, I've got positive feedback about the idea itself.
</p>
            <p>I would not give up this concept, but it will be interesting to develop a different idea and A/B test them. </p>
            <p>There is a lot of should be done in the future before this product could face the audience. There can be more journeys, more user needs, more devices and at the same time more complexity. My point is in keeping it simple and check the numbers.</p>
