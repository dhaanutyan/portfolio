            <h1>Designing SMM&amp;A flow‑based interface</h1>
            <h4>TDW allows users to generate live data feeds than can be viewed in reports from constantly changing and updating web data. Any online information can be pulled – from social media, search engines, specific websites to online databases.</h4>       
            <h3>The problem to think and to solve</h3>
            <p> Users have a poor first impression of the creator because it looks old and out-of-date. Perceiving that the creator is harder to use than it is and attributing a much lower value to what TDW actually does. Also, It is difficult to understand where/how to start using service, which actions can be taken with each icon and what to do next when building a query.</p>

                <h3>The question I start with</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <ul><li>What actually this tool does? </li>
                <li>Who uses this software and how? </li>
                <li>The process looks complicated for non-tech users. Can it be the other way? </li>
                <li>If it's not, how can I simplify this one? </li>
				<li>How solve the problem of icons and menus? Restyling is definitely not enough. There are also problems with the structure. </li></ul>
                <h3>Market research</h3>
                <p> We can classify TDW to SMM&amp;A software, with the main purpose to extract, transform and visualise information (some tools also help to reuse it, but it's not our case). </p>
                <p>Main players in the market are: Zoho Social, Hootsuite, Brand24, Synthesio, Sysomos, Brandwatch Analytics, Crimson Hexagon, Talkwalker, Buffer for Business. Let's check their interfaces! </p>        
                <p>Patterns of use divided on: 
                <ul><li>one time research (more based on extracting) </li>
                <li>non-stop monitoring (more based on visualising) </li>
                <li>reuse the information as a content (more based on transforming) provide different user journeys. </li></ul></p>
                <p>Extracting start from an idea of boolean logic in a search. It's is a type of search allowing users to combine keywords with operators such as AND, NOT and OR to further produce more relevant results. The interface of data mining tool should provide it with the more intuitive and interactive way. Transformation can include filtering, restructuring, mixing, changing of the informational stream. Of course, we need to think how to build an understandable interface of settings. But in our case, we also have a deal with different streams mixing. There is a lot of work with layout structure and drag and drop interactions as well. This question is pushing us to research a data flow interface for understanding if it's so intuitive as it looks and how it fits our audience. The visualizing part of SMM&amp;A software usually presented as a customizable dashboard with a lot of screens, especially for online monitoring. The main questions will be to prioritize presentation of data distinguishing to show the important and hide the secondary with flexible settings for any purpose. Heat maps can help with and there is definitely a need for information design skills.</p>
             
            <h3>Persona development</h3>
                <p>I collected and analyzed all information about service: videos, presentations, tutorial, mention in a press to understand how TDW see the audience and how the company expects their users will use the product. There was no possibility to collect all data directly from the customer database or inviting and interviewing clients. That's why to determine the target audience, I reviewed about 100 responses from customers about service work and identified the common professions, characteristics and needs. The point is we can use SMM&amp;A tools to collect data about SMM&amp;A tools! So I did. It helped to separate the main idea in 4 personas and looked on the interface through their experience. </p>

            <h3>Research again</h3>
                <p>The principle of interaction with the component-based graphical interface will be the same as a visual coding. (data flow or flow-based programming) So we are dealing with the same user experience and interface and can analyze it on a large number of examples. The problem is our users are not engineers, programmers or hackers. We need non-tech-user-friendly, a-lot-of-data-friendly, touch-friendly, small-devices-friendly interface. It can be checked on our audience and different devices before we start to draw. </p>

                <p>I defined the structure of current stage and rebuild it partly to simplify work with instruments. The most evident problem in logic of To make more significant changes I need to understand exactly how each element works and purpose it is used for. But even on this stage </p>

            <h3>Element system</h3>
                <p>Analysing the working principle of this interface, I made a number of simplifications in the data flow design. I merged tool, configuration and its result in one block and indicated all data on it. By double click, you can manage the element.  </p>
