            <h1>Gambling mobile application interface</h1>
            <h4>This mobile application is a part of a big gambling service also represented like desktop and mobile site. Including more than twenty different lotteries It is one of the most powerful digital reincarnation of good old lottery business with tickets, raffles, numbers and draws. </h4>
            <h3>The problem to think and to solve</h3>
            <p> In the one step of the social gambling network, Stoloto still has a lot of imperfections. One of them was the outdated version of their native app with limited functionality and its own style guide, not associated with other products. </p>

                <h3>The question I start with</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <ul><li>What actually this tool does? </li>
                <li>Who uses this software and how? </li>
                <li>The process looks complicated for non-tech users. Can it be the other way? </li>
                <li>If it's not, how can I simplify this one? </li>
				<li>How solve the problem of icons and menus? Restyling is definitely not enough. There are also problems with the structure. </li></ul>
                <h3>User flow</h3>
                <p>I collected and analyzed all information about service: videos, presentations, tutorial, mention in a press to understand how TDW see the audience and how the company expects their users will use the product. There was no possibility to collect all data directly from the customer database or inviting and interviewing clients. That's why to determine the target audience, I reviewed about 100 responses from customers about service work and identified the common professions, characteristics and needs. The point is we can use SMM&amp;A tools to collect data about SMM&amp;A tools! So I did. It helped to separate the main idea in 4 personas and looked on the interface through their experience. </p>

            <h3>Regestration</h3>
            <p>The principle of interaction with the component-based graphical interface will be the same as a visual coding. (data flow or flow-based programming) So we are dealing with the same user experience and interface and can analyze it on a large number of examples. The problem is our users are not engineers, programmers or hackers. We need non-tech-user-friendly, a-lot-of-data-friendly, touch-friendly, small-devices-friendly interface. It can be checked on our audience and different devices before we start to draw. </p>

            <h3>Informational Architecture</h3>
                <p>I defined the structure of current stage and rebuild it partly to simplify work with instruments. The most evident problem in logic of To make more significant changes I need to understand exactly how each element works and purpose it is used for. But even on this stage </p>

            <h3>Element system</h3>
                <p>Analysing the working principle of this interface, I made a number of simplifications in the data flow design. I merged tool, configuration and its result in one block and indicated all data on it. By double click, you can manage the element.  </p>
