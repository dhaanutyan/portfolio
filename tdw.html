            <h1>Designing SMM&amp;A flow‑based interface</h1>
            <h4>TDW allows users to generate live data feeds than can be viewed in reports from constantly changing and updating web data. Any online information can be pulled – from social media, search engines, specific websites to online databases.</h4>       
            <h3>The problem to think and to solve</h3>
            <p> Users have a poor first impression of the creator because it looks old and out-of-date. Perceiving that the creator is harder to use than it is and attributing a much lower value to what TDW actually does. Also, It is difficult to understand where/how to start using service, which actions can be taken with each icon and what to do next when building a query.</p>

                <h3>The question I start with</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <ul><li>What actually this tool does? </li>
                <li>Who uses this software and how? </li>
                <li>The process looks complicated for non-tech users. Can it be the other way? </li>
                <li>If it's not, how can I simplify this one? </li>
				<li>How solve the problem of icons and menus? Restyling is definitely not enough. There are also problems with the structure. </li></ul>
                <h3>Market research</h3>
                <p> We can classify TDW to SMM&amp;A software, with the main purpose to extract, transform and visualise information (some tools also help to reuse it, but it's not our case). </p>
                <p>Main players in the market are: Zoho Social, Hootsuite, Brand24, Synthesio, Sysomos, Brandwatch Analytics, Crimson Hexagon, Talkwalker, Buffer for Business. Let's check their interfaces! </p>        
                <p>Patterns of use divided on: 
                <ul><li>one time research (more based on extracting) </li>
                <li>non-stop monitoring (more based on visualising) </li>
                <li>reuse the information as a content (more based on transforming) provide different user journeys. </li></ul></p>
                <p>Extracting start from an idea of boolean logic in a search. It's is a type of search allowing users to combine keywords with operators such as AND, NOT and OR to further produce more relevant results. The interface of data mining tool should provide it with the more intuitive and interactive way. Transformation can include filtering, restructuring, mixing, changing of the informational stream. Of course, we need to think how to build an understandable interface of settings. But in our case, we also have a deal with different streams mixing. There is a lot of work with layout structure and drag and drop interactions as well. This question is pushing us to research a data flow interface for understanding if it's so intuitive as it looks and how it fits our audience. The visualizing part of SMM&amp;A software usually presented as a customizable dashboard with a lot of screens, especially for online monitoring. The main questions will be to prioritize presentation of data distinguishing to show the important and hide the secondary with flexible settings for any purpose. Heat maps can help with and there is definitely a need for information design skills.</p>
             
            <h3>Persona development</h3>
                <p>I collected and analyzed all information about service: videos, presentations, tutorial, mention in a press to understand how TDW see the audience and how the company expects their users will use the product. There was no possibility to collect all data directly from the customer database or inviting and interviewing clients. That's why to determine the target audience, I reviewed about 100 responses from customers about service work and identified the common professions, characteristics and needs. The point is we can use SMM&amp;A tools to collect data about SMM&amp;A tools! So I did. It helped to separate the main idea in 4 personas and looked on the interface through their experience. </p>

            <h3>Research again</h3>
                <p>The principle of interaction with the component-based graphical interface will be the same as a visual coding. (data flow or flow-based programming) So we are dealing with the same user experience and interface and can analyze it on a large number of examples. The problem is our users are not engineers, programmers or hackers. We need non-tech-user-friendly, a-lot-of-data-friendly, touch-friendly, small-devices-friendly interface. It can be checked on our audience and different devices before we start to draw. </p>

            <h3>Informational Architecture</h3>
                <p>The most evident problem in the logic of menu/submenu nested items.  Elements can't belong to different logic groups in this case. Also, keeping all items in one menu panel without nesting makes it too long. Users will get tired of scrolling and confused to choose the right one. I defined the structure of current stage and rebuild it to simplify the interaction with the Source, Options and Extract. To make more significant changes it needs to understand exactly how each element works and how users expect it works. It's evidently time for inviting focus groups and playing in card sorting with them. </p>

            <h3>User Flow</h3>
                <p>What problem are users trying to solve? Let's took one of our personas George who cares a lot to protect online reputation of his company. So he needs to track his brand mentions across the globe, on every network. He got and opened the TDW. Complete registration process. Watch some tutorials. Create a new query, add Twitter as a first source. Find right options for twitter to get last 200 posts with mention the name of his company.  Add translator from any non-English language to English and all information extract to table keeping just post and county it came from. Then he creates two filters to sort all posts into two groups with positive and negative feedback, mentioning proper words. With another element on board, he merges all information to create chart how feedback about his company and see how the ratio of opinions depends on the territorial factor. The last element sends all the information to the dashboard with special properties to renew it every 24 ours and send him notification by e-mail. Now he can repeat this procedure with other sources like Facebook and sleep at night quietly.

            <h3>Layout structure</h3>
            <p>TDW is planing to be a web servise, but a complex interface and modern browsers possibilites require equating its design approach to creating UI for desktop application. Based on the above and results of research UI of flow-based software we define the graph editing process as: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Adding new components </li>
              <li>Seeing compatible places for making a connection </li>
            <li>Finding the available components and graphs </li>
            <li>Moving the components </li>
            <li>Changing properties </li></ul>
            <p>By double click, you can manage the component in the pop-up or right side panel. We'll use the left panel like functional menu and right one like properties for choosen elements. As any flow-based interface requires a lot of space, we will give the panels dynamic properties to free the work area and return on demand. </p>

            <h3>Element system</h3>
            <p>There was the amount of simplifications maid in the data flow design: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Tool, configuration and its result was merged in one block and indicated all data on it.</li>
              <li>Created color system for links and elements, including special color to mark all non active connectors. </li>
              <li>Visualized the information passing through the graph </li>
              <li>Added an icon inside each component to represent the type of element and mark the difference between them. </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
     </div>
</div>
                <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="images/tdw_7.png" alt="">

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
            <h3>Compact view</h3>
            <p>Browser-based flow editor makes it easy to wire together graph's element using nodes. But there is still a problem with some of the flow-based editors if they dive into too much detail, making graphs confusibly disorientetad. Vertical and horisontal scrolling change to scaling and moving work area to any side. the amount of information inside each component changes by scaling. Managing the blocks we can easy stick it together to get more space or drag and drop it by any touch interface wich make this system ready for mobile devices. </p>

            <h3>Adding new element</h3>
            <p>For adding a new element we can have two different ways. We can drag and drop any item to work area or push on “plus” button and also get the menu.&nbsp;The items are not associated with the current one will mark as inactive.It is also possible add two elemets and connect them afterwards.</p>

            <h3>Work area</h3>
            <p>The visual style of main service page is represent in dark color by defolt with possibilities to change it. It relies on TDW brandbook style guide. Navigation represent by tool panels from each side. (both can be closed if we need it) and some functional item in the bottom.  The right panel came to replace browser frame. Now we can use it for the browser if it is for URL, for preferences, if it is a filter or for the tutorial. Left menu elements are supplemented with icons. Same icons will be on graf element after we drug and drop it to work area. Also we can change query, close save it or back to home page. </p>

            <h3>Tutorial</h3>
            <p>The best design of course, like a good joke, doesn't need an explanation, but unfortunately, in this case, there's enough complexity. The tutorial system is a combination of methods that includes:</p>
            <ul><li>Help guideline to read on cold winter nights; </li>
            <li>Video lessons, blog and ready presets. </li>
            <li>First-enter escort;</li>
            <li>Hover boxes with information about the items being hovered;</li>

                <p>The color's functional and aesthetic roles for Hololens must be reconsidered in relation to the user's real surroundings. In difference of mobile and desktop devices users use gestures to take action. How Hololens support discrete gestures like air-tap and continuous gestures like navigation and manipulation.</p>
